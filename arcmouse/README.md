# arcmouse

created by: galapagoose

allows your arc2 to move your mouse. primarily designed to edit parameters in ableton live with a physical control. simply click on the parameter with the mouse then turn the 1st encoder to move it up or down. after you've clicked you can turn the 2nd encoder clockwise to engage the 'command' key for finer control (but remember to turn it back after you're done!).
