Expressive Interactive Live Chord Builder for 40h (64) + Arc2.

## Features

pipedream is a software instrument made for people who want to use
the arc in a performative, melodic way. Much like a bag pipe'd be used.

pipedream utilizes the sensitivity and LED feedback from the arc in
explorative and clear ways. It is a developing tool in the art of
subtle manipulation.



## Instructions

Turn the DSP on
+ Connect Arc + Grid to pipedream.

When your Monome starts smoking,
simply click the Begin button underneath
the SerialOSC windows.

Once the Begin toggle box is unchecked, the monome window becomes
a display window. The flashing buttons represent scale degrees,

Root
Minor Third
Major Third
Perfect Fifth
Major Seventh
+ Octave

selecting one of the flashing scale degree selects a note that the arc's first
encoder will combine when rotated clockwise. 

This is the magic of pipedream. 

The two rows to the right of the flashing row are a 13 step keyboard,
and to the right of that is an LFO manipulator (scale) and an octave
UP and DOWN (top and bottom buttons of the right-most column).

Open up the pipedream, and pack a little dream for meeee..

ALSO, open up your favorite VST and connect the keyboard to your favorite
BASS sounds for added control!

## Arc Mapping

Encoder 0 controls the rate of digital oxygen being blown into the instrument. This utilizes stretta's INERTIA arc primitive.

Encoder 1 controls the LFO through which the bagpipe plays through!
