# clARCk 

Arc 4 Clock, with 4 styles of display and some minor interaction.  Really just a technical demo to get warmed up.

Open the patch up, connect in the serialosc window and a 4 display clock should start. From left to right, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, Milliseconds.  The pulse setting is a quarter hour flashing indicator to make it slightly easier to read (idea borrowed from Cassiels clock, props to Nick!). Pulse flickers at .25 of a second. Press the arc encoders will toggle between the two view modes, single point and progress so far. Turning the 1st and 4th encoder controls the intensity of the on/off states for the pulse.
