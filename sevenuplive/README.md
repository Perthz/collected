SevenUp Live is a MaxForLive application that combines 8 different monome applications into one interface.  With it, your monome communicates with Ableton Live and allows MLR-like functionality along with other goodies like sliders, sequencing melodies, creating patterns of beats, saving/loading your songs, and more.
