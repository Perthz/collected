# Monomodular

Modular Enviroment and Monome- Emulator for Grid Controllers like Livid Ohm 64, APC 20/40 and others

created by: aumhaa

Monomodular is roughly based on a server/client principle, with Monomodular acting as an intermediary between the various Mods and supported controllers. As of version b993, Monomodular allows native communication with patches/M4L devices specifically designed to work with monome hardware, without needing anything else, using SerialOSC.

Supported controllers Akai's APC 20 and APC 40

Livid's Block

Livid's Code

Apple's iPad, using either TouchOSC or Lemur

Novation's Launchpad

Livid's Ohm64

In addition, there is a custom tie-in script for Livid's CNTRL:R that the author uses: Livid's CNTRL:R

Mods

A 'Mod' is just a convenient name for m4l patches designed to be used with Monomodular. They all share at least one thing: they contain a javascript object that communicates directly with the Monomodular Python script, which in turn communicates with Monomodular embedded _Framework control surface scripts. An explanation of how this works, and examples of ways to use certain parts of the javascript, are contained in the Monomods_help patch that is installed in the folder with the rest of the Mods. Some of the Mods are creations of amounra, while others are ports of Monome patches (mostly Stretta's). Each one will function in an independant way, but they all have several things in common with one another. To learn about the common ground that all plugins share, you should take a look at the How Monomodular Works page. The specifics of each Mod, however, are covered on the following pages that can reached by clicking on the header of each of the following summaries:
