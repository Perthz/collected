> 8 chord slots, setting chord is easy with per note / per chord / all chords transpose buttons
> 4 tracks, each can select a different chord, note velocity, duration, resistance, midi output and channel
> 4 "strum" speeds in each direction (user configureable for full version max users)
> preset management system that remembers everything from chords to track parameters

have a look at the video for better understanding.

thanks to member GreaterThanZero for his physical speed/resistance code "throw" (http://post.monome.org/comments.php?DiscussionID=13138&page=2)

for full version max users, you can edit the message objects in the subpatch "pushforce.maxpat" to get the desired acceleration amount for each button

**tutorials**
1 - edit the chords
2 - select midi output device and midi channel
3 - adjust midi note velocity, duration and resistance to your liking
4 - select chord for each channel with 1-4 columns and drag/push the "playhead" with 5-8 columns
