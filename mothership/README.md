Visual Musical Playground for 40h (64) + Arc2.

**Features:**

Mothership is a software instrument made for people who dig loops
and enjoy improvising live. 

It utilizes the mlr functionality that has become synonymous with
monome-based music, chromatic keyboard function (for jamming / creating
bass lines), and an FX control for loops (like SP404s + other popular 
samplers).



**Instructions:**

MAKE SURE TO CONNECT THE GRRRRIDDDD FIRST!
IMPORTANT FOR THE LED BANGBANG. :)

The grid is divided up into three component parts:

The first three rows are mlr-style sequencers that buffer
loops (be it melody, bass, drums, etc.).

Rows 3-6 work as a midi-keyboard ideally sent to a VST that would trigger
sounds of your choosing (Ableton Live drum kits, Massive wobbled bass, etc.)

Also, three buttons on Row 4 (1 + 2 + 7) are the Group OFF buttons for the MLR
groups 1, 2 + 3 respectively.

Row 7 is an FX controller, dependent on what effect you have selected from row 8, it works with button presses, but is much more smooth on the Arc's first encoder.

Row 8 has two functions - the first and last buttons (1 + 8) are octave down and octave up (respectively) for the Midi Keyboard (rows 3-6).


**Arc Mapping:**

Encoder 0 controls different FX when toggled with the middle 6 buttons of Row 8
on the grid.

Encoder 1 controls the Master Volume for the three MLR groups.
