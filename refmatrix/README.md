# Refmatrix

here's an edit of the midi version of refmatrix i've been having fun with for a bit so thought i'd share.

in short - it now has 4 grids, each assignable to seperate midi channels. playback and switching between grids for input are handled on the monome.
uses serialosc. * update - now has optional random velocity, cc's and octaves available per grid*

it can be seen in action in this excellent video by nightmorph (thank you).
