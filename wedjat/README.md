Time Bending Beat Station for 40h (64) + Arc2.

## Features:

wedjat is a software instrument made for people who want to use
the arc in a performative, rhythmic way. Much like a turn table
of the 2012 kind.

wedjat utilizes the sensitivity and LED feedback from the arc in
explorative and clear ways. It is a developing tool in the art of
subtle manipulation.



## Instructions:

Turn the DSP on
+ Connect Arc + Grid to wedjat.

When your Monome starts having
signal flares, simply click one
of the four quadrants of your grid.

This toggles on one of three pre-made 
drum kits (which are all replaceable in the max window,
or the application folder.)

All you need, now, is to tap the arc knobs slightly,
and begin finding the rhythm that is most suitable to you.


Finally, the fourth quadrant is
hooked up to the internal microphone
in your computer. Simply hold down one
of the center four buttons of the fourth
quadrant to begin a live recording into two-
second buffer. These sounds are playable only
after recording, so make sure to get them in
there first. 

(hint: I hum melodies or run an analog synth right next to the mic
for odd rhythm / melody triggers. Experiment, friends!)

## Arc Mapping:

Both Encoders work as ultra-sensitive drum hits.
Clockwise movement strikes one note, while counter clockwise
strikes another.
