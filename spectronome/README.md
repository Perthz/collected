## Grid controls

* Button 0,0 toggles between spectrogram and sonogram modes
* Button 0,1 toggles between linear and logarithmic frequency scale
* Button 0,2 toggles between linear and logarithmic amplitude scale
* Button 0,3 toggles discrete led display
* Button 0,4 toggles sonogram scroll direction
* The last row controls the smoothing co-efficient, from 0 (the left-most button) to 0.5 (the right-most button)
* Holding down a button while pressing another button will resize and move the display into the rectangle bounded by those two buttons...if that makes sense.  Give it a try.
