ported into max for live [note: channel routing is so poor in m4l I actually find this inferior to using the max version in combination with rewire/soundflower]

added momentary/latching record functionality

v032

added vu sensitivity dial in the ui
increased the playback speed encoder range from 3x to 6x
added adjustable gain and output channel for each voice

fixed the LED feedback bug on 64/128 - thanks to r1v1era/flyingoctopus/watson
added midi record functionality

v030

extended to 16 voices [128/256]

fixed encoder 0 bug where leds remain lit post focus change
fixed encoder 1 bug where press should 0 lfo
implemented encoder 2 as as playback speed control, press to set to 1x playback
implemented encoder 3 as channel volume control, default at 40% [256] 80% [64/128], press to return to default after edit

shifted focus/record/playback buttons to bottom of grid (15/14/13 respectively) [256 only]
