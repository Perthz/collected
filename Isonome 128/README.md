# Isonome 128

Isomorphic MIDI interface that provides all needed visual feedback on the monome.

This little guy splits a 128 in half vertically, in such a way that the 
left 64 buttons act as an isomorphic MIDI interface that is capable of sending 
MIDI note data to whatever you please.

Upon initialization and connection to a grid, you'll see pretty lights. 
Everything on the left is the isomorphic keyboard, and all the lit
pads are the tonic note. the 8x8 grid spans a total of 5 octaves, and
is designed so that no matter what 'shape' you play (e.g. a triangle)
the same chord quality will be maintained within the context of that key.

on the right side you have access to 8 modes, as well as all 12 keys, thus
it allows for easy modulations, both diatonically and modally. I threw in 
two columns to adjust velocity - and just for the hell of it, there's a
4x4 pad bank on the right side (4,8 through 11,7) that's mapped chromatically
to C1 - to be used primarily with Ableton Live's drum racks.

I suggest firing up a synth or sampler and fooling around. this thing makes for
writing arguably more complex modulations with ease! 

I'm sure there are bugs, and though I initially created it for myself
(i'm left-handed ;) if someone finds something horribly wrong with it, I'd be happy
to revise it.
