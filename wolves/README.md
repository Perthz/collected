here is a patch that will make your sounds howl and growl. the top row triggers chimes, made from sinusoidal peaks of the input signal. the next rows will do the same but also transpose each sinusoid by a harmonic interval.

start by turning the thing on

turn up the volume

select input (sample or adc)

and start howling at your monome.
