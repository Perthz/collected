designed for the monome 64 and arc2

The grid displays several parameters (pitch, amplitude level, attack, decay, portamento time and filter cutoff) per step. Instead of using the grid to enter in data, which would be fairly coarse, the grid is used to indicate which step (vertical) and which parameter (horizontal) is in focus. The parameter value is abstracted twice, both on the grid and arc ring. Once any parameter is selected on the grid, the value for all visible steps are displayed.
