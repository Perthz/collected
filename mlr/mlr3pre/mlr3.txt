quickstart:

__ monomeserial prefix set to /mlr

__ audio file loading

1. drop files or folders onto the file list on the right
2. top and bottom grey bars are scroll up/down (mapped to keys a/z)
3. click filename to show preview (shift a/z moves up/down one file)

__ channel setup (large wave view) and channel list (rows)

1. setup reflects highlighted channel (from the channel list below)
2. to assign file to channel:
	- click "assign selected clip" below the wave view (key: x)
	- shift-click the channel list box
	(hint: to assign files quickly, hold down shift, use keys a/z and click channel list)

__ turn on the dac (located on the far bottom left)

__ rows on monome device correspond to channels (top row is special functions)
	- hit monome keys on second row, given you have a file loaded on channel 0
	
__ click channel list boxes also ("virtual device")



notes (in the place of real docs):

__ wave selection
1. ctrl - toggle "loop" selection mode
2. apple/win - toggle "move" mode
3. try "snap" to grid then set grid-sub to 16

__ channel setup
1. "slaved" matches playback speed to global tempo.
2. "octave" and "transpose" only apply when "slaved"

__ groups
1. orange drop-down is for routing.
2. number next to "stop" is playback speed of current clip.
3. panning

__ setup / group
1. fade is in ms. cross-fade between clips, not in-out. for the old clicks, set to 0.
2. per-group quantize, off included.

__ setup / sync
1. this should work? totally untested. relies completely on max/msp's sync~ object.

__ setup / vst
1. "select" lets you choose a vst plugin
2. "window" loads the vst window
3. "cc-route" lets you map midi cc to vst param. all auto-filled, with learn function

__ setup / row
1. this is an experiment-- dynamic top row routing. press and toggle modes available.
2. currently available sends:

route
vol
mute
pan

example: group 1 volume to 100 on press, return to 127 (unity) on release

1vol 100		1vol 127




not-yet-implemented list:

- pattern recorder functions not mapped to monome keys
- presets
- session file saving
- sublooping (two-press within row)
- live recording
- reverse?
- vst cc setup saving
